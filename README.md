# Quality Assurance Techniques for Big Data Applications: A Systematic Literature Review

SUMMARY
================================================================================
This package contains two tables, and table information-extraction is 83 main references and information extraction. The information includes Study Title, Publication Year, type of paper,	Authors,	Context study,	Big Data propertie,s	Quality attributes, Technology	,Quality assurance techniques, Experimental results/conclusion,	Strengths,	and Existing challenges/Future work. These information is very important for the research of the quality of big data application. 

The other table is 102 papers that are extracted, including source, 	title,	type,	Year and Retrieval source.

Data search strategy 
================================================================================
The goal of this systematic review is thoroughly examining the literature on QA techniques for big data applications. Three main phases of SLR is presented by EBSE (EvidenceBased Software Engineering) guidelines that include planning, execution, reporting results, and the search strategy is an indispensable part of them. In this search strategy, an automatic search and a manual search are both useful. In order to choose the main studies that are very relevant to our research, the search strategy has been divided into two stages. We next describe each stage of our search process in detail: 

Stage 1: Database search

We carried out automatic searches on seven databases including ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Engineering Village, Springer Link, ISI Web of Science, Scopus and Science Direct, which are the largest and most complete scientiÔ¨Åc databases that include computer science. In this stage, we manually downloaded and searched the proceedings if venues not included in the digital libraries, a total of 3328 papers were collected.

Stage 2: Grey literature

We manually searched google Scholar with the defined search terms which is the topic of the research. In this stage, our main purpose is to manually find out the relevant documents that may be missed in the electronic database. We have increased from the initial 103 articles to 121 articles by snowballing, and finally selected 83 articles through detailed discussion.

Data management tool(NoteExpress)
================================================================================
We use NoteExpress to do data management. NoteExpress has the function of document information retrieval and download, which can be used to manage the bibliographies of references, and to manage the full text of references or documents in any format by attachments. Data mining can help users quickly understand the latest progress in a research direction, views and so on. In addition to managing the above explicit knowledge, instantaneous tacit knowledge such as diaries, scientific research experiences, and draft papers can also be recorded through NoteExpress's note-taking function, and can be linked to bibliographic titles.
