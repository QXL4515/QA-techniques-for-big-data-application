# Quality Assurance Techniques for Big Data Applications: A Systematic Literature Review

SUMMARY
================================================================================
This package contains two tables, and table information-extraction is 58 main references and information extraction. The information includes Study Title, Publication Year, type of paper,	Authors,	Context study,	Big Data propertie,s	Quality attributes, Technology	,Quality assurance techniques, Experimental results/conclusion,	Strengths,	and Existing challenges/Future work. These information is very important for the research of the quality of big data application. 

The other table is 94 papers that are extracted, including source, 	title,	type,	Year and Retrieval source.

Data search strategy 
================================================================================
The goal of this systematic review is thoroughly examining the literature on QA techniques for big data applications. Three main phases of SLR is presented by EBSE (EvidenceBased Software Engineering) guidelines that include planning, execution, reporting results, and the search strategy is an indispensable part of them. In this search strategy, an automatic search and a manual search are both useful. In order to choose the main studies that are very relevant to our research, the search strategy has been divided into two stages. We next describe each stage of our search process in detail: 

Stage 1: Manual search

We manually searched google Scholar and Baidu Scholar with the search string “Quality Assurance for Big Data Applications” which is the topic of the research. Then, we manually browsed the abstract and keywords of relevant journals and conference proceedings, and get related papers. At the same time, manual analysis of relevant papers can yield key words related to quality assurance of big data applications. Therefore, manual search has been used to elicit pilot studies and to reﬁne the search string. Inaddition, we also ﬁnalized the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In this stage, we can understand the QA techniques for big data applications, and ﬁnally obtain 52 initial related literature. 

Stage 2: Automatic search

We carried out automatic searches on six databases including ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Engineering Village, Springer Link, ISI Web of Science and Science Direct, which are the largest and most complete scientiﬁc databases that include computer science.

Data management tool(NoteExpress)
================================================================================
We use NoteExpress to do data management. NoteExpress has the function of document information retrieval and download, which can be used to manage the bibliographies of references, and to manage the full text of references or documents in any format by attachments. Data mining can help users quickly understand the latest progress in a research direction, views and so on. In addition to managing the above explicit knowledge, instantaneous tacit knowledge such as diaries, scientific research experiences, and draft papers can also be recorded through NoteExpress's note-taking function, and can be linked to bibliographic titles.
